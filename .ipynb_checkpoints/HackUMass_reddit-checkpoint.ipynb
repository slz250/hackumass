      "I agree that would help a lot of us. I guess it's a negative momentum thing for a lot of us, previous bad relationships or being rejected, you start to give up, you start to fear meeting new people and getting bad reactions again. I haven't met a new person in so long. \n",
      "Does it help you?\n",
      "It’s awful, it makes me even more depressed. \n",
      "I used to feel this way. But then I stared going on social media more often and realised that was all fake. There were people who spent the night at a party crying, or fighting with someone, or being bored, but their pictures revealed happy, fake smiles. People don't want others to think they're a downer online. Have you had any help for this? It would be very beneficial.\n",
      "What was your memory for back then?\n",
      "It's annoying isn't it? At least if you felt depressed you'd know you have a mental illness and that's what's wrong with you, this just feels like you're OK but slowly losing all of your qualities and just wasting your life. And your reaction to it is just emptiness.\n",
      "\n",
      "People who used to like you lose interest, you can see it in their faces how they're just thinking \"When did you become so boring? You used to be different\". And it's your fault, because you know they're right, you did change and you don't know why.\n",
      "It's always painful when something like that happens, but there isn't much you can do when people refuse to be reasonable. You made a mistake, people are flawed, it happens. Can you not even speak to the very original person you met when this all started? At least explain to him that you simply didn't hear what was going on? If not, sometimes you simply have no choice, the friendships are lost and you let it hurt for a while and then move on. Especially in a situation like this, it just sounds like a really stupid reason and nothing that you can sit around hurting over for months. It sucks, but ask yourself if you really want to be friends with such unreasonable people aside from the fact that it hurts right now and you wish you could undo it. I'd want better friends than that. \n",

Now I'm 30 and I can read a post like this and feel like an 18 year old has plenty of time to figure things out. It's normal that you feel left out if you hadn't had relationships like other people, but they are such a waste of time when you are too young. Some immature girl would break your heart and then you'd be here talking about how much it hurts to be left behind like so many other people are here posting about. If you were 28 I'd say yeah you're a little behind schedule. You still have time to be young and meet someone and do things together.\n",

      "Might not be the greatest idea that you're looking to the two female friends you already have as a source of people to ask out. You can try if you want to, but it can ruin friendships. As far as that friend who will invite himself along too, then you have no choice that it'll have to be an email or a phone call to ask the other girl. You can just say you wanted to ask in person but there are always other people around.\n",
      "\n",
      "Depending on where you live there's probably a dating website or app you can use and that makes it a lot easier to have a lot more options of who to ask. You have to put yourself out there, the only way to solve this problem is to ask as many people as you can. Anyone successful in dating will tell you that, you don't get somebody to say yes until you are comfortable hearing 10 people say no. Get used to hearing no, don't take it personally,  understand there very much are females out there where if they asked you out you might not want to for whatever reason, not attracted, don't feel any spark, and that doesn't mean you disregard them as a person or think they are horrible. That's just how it works. We can't all feel something for every single person. So make yourself immune to hearing no, it doesn't matter. The only person who matters is the one who will say yes. If you think you are wasting your years, then hurry up and start asking as many as you can. \n",
      "yes, it's really annoying and the worst part there is nothing I can do about it. seriously though this is so relatable I thought it was me for a second. I don't have anyone I could call a  friend anymore. I have no social skills at all and I don't know how to handle myself in social situations im either extremely unfunny, confusing, awkward.\n",
      "Sometimes we need to take a step back and consider how we'd respond to our thoughts if we were trying to help someone else. And in your case I hope you realise it is much easier to get the guts to put yourself outside of your comfort zone in an attempt to make friends (i.e. try visiting some gaming cafes/lounges where you won't stand out being socially awkward if that is the case) rather than 'getting out of here' which is an all too permanent solution for what may only be a temporary problem.\n",
      "I do the same but I realize I have nothing to say because I don't do anything but sit around and be depressed\n",
      "I can't say much as someone chronically unemployed except common sense. Feel free to enjoy your new freedom, but of course if you fully support yourself or have bills to pay, it's time to start looking for something else right now. Yes, that's a reasonable fear that if you went too long without finding something, you aren't going to feel happy forever. All you can do is try, the job market is still competitive all over the place. If you know you need income, start applying to every reasonable opening you see. \n",
      "Yeah, a lot of people seem to say that when it's not exactly true. I too am someone for which it is a literal statement. Can't remember the last time I saw anybody but family. \n",
      "Thanks for your help, what I'm experiencing is definitely a type of numbness, so maybe I'm depressed after all. You're right that it won't resolve itself and I should work on it, it's just that everytime I do it's when I engage in a conversation and realize I have nothing interesting to say. It's not that I overthink while having conversations, it's that I'm not even thinking. It's like my mind is absent, only yes, no, and simple short answers come out of my mouth.\n",

Now I'm 30 and I can read a post like this and feel like an 18 year old has plenty of time to figure things out. It's normal that you feel left out if you hadn't had relationships like other people, but they are such a waste of time when you are too young. Some immature girl would break your heart and then you'd be here talking about how much it hurts to be left behind like so many other people are here posting about.

You have to put yourself out there, the only way to solve this problem is to ask as many people as you can. Anyone successful in dating will tell you that, you don't get somebody to say yes until you are comfortable hearing 10 people say no. Get used to hearing no, don't take it personally,  understand there very much are females out there where if they asked you out you might not want to for whatever reason, not attracted, don't feel any spark, and that doesn't mean you disregard them as a person or think they are horrible. That's just how it works. We can't all feel something for every single person. So make yourself immune to hearing no, it doesn't matter. The only person who matters is the one who will say yes. If you think you are wasting your years, then hurry up and start asking as many as you can. \n",

It isn't easy I know but if we blame others and never look in the mirror we can't change anything. I'm not asking you to instantly change, I know that it's an impossible task. Take baby steps! Lets say you start with waking up on time, on the next day you do the same but eat a proper breakfast and take a shower. Work on yourself slow and steady.\n",

On a bad day just looking at my bank balance would make me wish I were dead.  Those feelings have passed, for now.  Medication, exercise and twice a week therapy seems to be working.\n",
      "I can relate, I try to create situations and try to be more social but nothing works. It seems as I'm just one lonely guy in someone else's big world occupied with fun people except that never happens to me. People avoid me but I'm not a bad persons idkmwhy \n",

During lunch I'm so lonely no one interacts with me, does nothing, but to each other they all act like there family. I just feel like I'm stuck in a bubble all the time.\n",

I remember msging people wishing them happy birthday, I always send everyone a msg and greet them the day of their birthday. But they still avoid me . I feel like on my birthday is the only day where I'm almost equal to everyone else because people talk to me and msg. But even then friends I've known since elementary don't even care.

Was he just never interested in really getting to know you? Does he really expect to find some fantasy girl that's always happy?\n",

Heck, I've even created two personalities — one's the nice guy who tries to make me feel better, and the other is the condescending asshole, the one who constantly criticises and berates me — with whom I converse.

Both me and my sister grew up to be some kind of fucked up adults, my mother was our only example of how an adult should be and she was kind of a horrible person. Everything in my life is fucked up, Im currently in a place where is impossible to find a job (especially as an expat in a little city) and my original country sucks if we are talking about the quality of life.\n",

I can't get a job, I don't like going out because I am ashamed of myself as a person. I've been depressed since I can remember, when we were little my mother would express her feelings of stress and frustration on us, saying things like that she will set the house on fire when we are sleeping because if it would be better if we would die. That you can't do nothing with your life if you are born poor. I had to take care of my dying grandpa' when I was like 15 and I was full of acnee. I was always miserable, didn't get to finish highschool, skipping school felt like the only time when I didn't have to tell my mother where I am, she wasn't able to tell me what to do. \n",

      "Greetings, Sorry for your sufferings. Its good you are searching for help. I think the root of your problem is the stresses on your body, the food you take, the work, the parenting, the relationship. Its hard to find balance with so much stress put on the body, its nice to have some time for yourself to just breathe, catch your breath, breathe \n",
      "\n",
      "The way i see it; There are a few ways to move into the right direction. \n",
      "1st thing: Food, you need to understand this process of your body needing food for energy. You see the food you eat has to be digested this takes energy, you may know the feeling of absolutely being stuffed with food after a big dinner party, maybe at Christmas or something. The body will feel tired and all we want is to go to bed, why is this ? Well the body wants to shut all other processes, the mind, the muscles, etc, in order to focus all its energy on digestion.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I hope you see that the body also needs energy for digestion, sometimes the energy spend on digestion is more than the energy gained by eating the food! One needs to be careful not to let the body be busy with digestion too much during the day, you will feel tired.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Id advice you to go for more easy digestible foods, all foods you listed are heavy on the digestion you will feel tired from them, another thing you can try is to do One meal a day (OMAD) or two meal a day, this way the body has more time to digest and actually gain energy from our foods. You can also try fasting for a day or two, only take water, and note how you feel. You will probably feel energized, try it sometime you will see how this works. \n",
      "\n",
      "Also Your excuse of not having the time to eat healthy, eating 4 avocados will take you less time than to order or bake a pizza. This is not an excuse there are many good food options that are faster than fast food.\n",
      "\n",
      "2cdn thing: Sleeping, you say your sleep is not a problem. It may not be. Do you wake on an alarm ? If that is the case this may present a problem. You see sleep works in cycles, when you wake up on the wrong time you feel sluggish. A person on 6 hrs of sleep can feel more energized than a person on 8 hours but has been woken at the wrong time. A better way to do this is to wake up naturally, you could go to bed earlier and let yourself wake up naturally, and only set an alarm as a backup. This involves some math figuring out how late you need to go to bed, but just go to bed earlier and let the body sleep and naturally wake up. \n",
      "\n",
      "3th thing: time for yourself, this does not have to be long, but its nice to have a few min each day devoted to yourself. Meditation might help you, just focussing on the breath without being disturbed by anyone. Youd need to find a place in your schedule where you can fit this in. Maybe when you wake up earlier than everyone else this is a peacefull time to be with yourself.\n",
      "\n",
      "I believe that doing these things will move you in the right direction. After this is done and you have more energy you can move to the other problems. \n",
      "\n",
      "Good luck, feel free to PM or ask questions\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "Thank you! I am glad to see I am not alone, I often found that helping people with their sadness makes me happy. I will try to pm you if i've got the time.\n",
      "I've had this issue. Then i realized that it was true, i had no one to talk to. This was the current reality i found myself in, I accepted this reality and there was no problem anymore. I mean there was nothing i could do in that moment, so all was good.  \n",
      "later I've simply tryed to put myself into more situation when i can do this, have coverstation with people that i enjoy doing, thats all i could think off doing about it. One could do this trough internet or irl searching for like minded , open people \n",
      "I just lost my best friend (female) as well as my wanna be girlfriend. I was faced with an ultimatum between the two, jealousy. And when I finally decided, the other decided she had enough. Now I have no one. Just thought I would let you know it is not just you. <3\n",
      "Hey! It’s gonna be okay. Unfortunately not everyone has the same support system in place and that really sucks but what have YOU done to get out of that situation? Have you tried finding a job to pay for lessons and a car yourself? Some of us have to do it all on our own... I’ve done it and yeah it sucked and it was difficult but i did what I had to do to to get what I wanted. You always have options. And forget your family, they sound like they suck. Make a family of your own since the one you were given is so crappy to you. Cheer up.. it will make a difference when you meet someone. Don’t forget to always try something different. There’s someone out there for everyone, you just have to look a little harder. \n",
      "Hey there. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy has been shown to be as effective and often times more effective than medication. Is it possible to find a therapist trained in CBT in your area? I was in a severe depression and picked up the book Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy. It's helped a lot so far.\n",
      "My psychiatrist told me there are longitudinal studies that link long term benzo use to early onset Alzheimer's.  I would guess this is why they want you off of them.  I don't have any experience at all with gabapentin, but I wish you the best of luck. \n",
      "It's alright, don't need money to make you happy. Money can make you depressed like right now. I got 150 bucks stolen by someone while I was out of town so I feel you. Just find something to do that you like that doesn't involve money. Just leave it be because you'll make 70 bucks back in the future. Just know where your money goes this time, and know who to trust. Better getting taken 70 bucks, than something like 3000 in the future. \n",
      "I think friends and co-workers should be different groups. It doesn't really matter if they trash talk you. I trash talk my friends and they trash talk me all the time. Maybe the trash talks keeps you guys together lol. You can always find people to talk to. There's 7.2 billion people, and if you don't feel comfortable with your co-workers, go find people. What you like to do can bring people to you too. Not going to stop feeling lonely if you complain about it, do something. Unless complaining is what you like to do, then by all means complain haha, no judgement\n",
      "\n",
      "Yooo that's some hard stuff. I'd say that you shouldn't try to make people change for you, but find people that can change you. If your mom is always going to blow up on you, then don't bother. That goes, if anyone keeps blowing up on you, then don't bother. Family or not. Fear not, college is one of the best opportunities to make friends. If you don't try now, then you'll have a harder time in the future. Just try sitting by someone and just start a small convo. If they seem interested, then keep it going. If not, then try the next person. A little adrenaline don't hurt. Can't make something happen if you don't try. Friends are my family. Parents can be let go, siblings can be let go, marriage is bound by law, your kids can grow up to be let go, and friends can be there or not depending on how you interact. Marriage isn't something to look at until you yourself is settled. Plus, if you do have a kid. Don't let that kid experience what you went through. Make it something different, so you can feel happy for what you missed out as a kid with him or her. Represent the character you want to be, not the one that suffered. \n",
      "What's 7 cups?\n",
      "When I felt alone, depressed and saddened before, I would cry and just tell myself that things were okay. Felt like the biggest lie ever, but it probably really did help me. Crying is at least some form of catharsis. I felt vulnerable and weak, but it felt so much better to just let it out, and in that moment of vulnerability, to try and convince myself that things weren't as bad as they seemed. I'd randomly even have to leave classes sometimes, just run to the bathroom or some place I could hide and just do that. I don't really think I have any good advice for you about this, but that's what I had to do to get through my pain.\n",
      "Thank you for sharing. I've never really been on here before, so I don't know the history of your TMS treatments, but it sounds convincing and like it's going well. I hope it turns out okay, and that you find your highs again eventually. I agree with taking the small victories btw.. those can be the most important, because they're often the most numerous, and sometimes, it's really just what's needed haha. Thanks again for the post\n",
      "Hey, I think I commented in your last thread. I just finished my own treatment a couple days ago... No noticeable difference, unfortunately. I'm going to talk to the doctor about the possibility of extending the treatment, but I kind of doubt it. Glad you're seeing some improvement though!\n",
      "I agree, I've cut down on starchy foods and a meat-based diet so that I feel light and more energised. Often processed food can be the crutch instead of drugs/alcohol/etc. what I found was to slow your eating, think about what you are putting in yourself with each mouthful. Processed food feels better when you are cramming it down yourself rather than if you experience each mouthful slowly. Fruit is a great way of freeing up the digestive system and making you feel more fresh and lively. Bread and grains have a tendency to really weigh you down and if you allow your gut to feel nurtured then it will repay you with a better state of being. Maybe take a little time to talk to your daughter about how and why she feels the way she does rather than to go on the offensive. Snap reactions can make us get angry with ourselves and if you try to find ways of cooling the tension it may alleviate some of the stress.\n",

(physical as in going through this grind takes its toll on our bodies. ) so we grind and we achieve goals and some of us sometimes even achieve those financial goals. they are in a place that by society standards you make you \"happy and content\" . but we are not that, because our souls (<--essence? consciousness?) are misaligned . Goals have been achieved but Dreams have been Forgotten - now we are stuck in this confusing place - wondering what the hell is wrong with us. nothing is wrong with You -or me- for thinking these things - it is your Heart and Soul telling you that there is something you have forgotten , trying to warn you to find it .

Maybe within those memories there are important things inside that can help you move towards a positive future.
